Kidney Disease Classification

This repository contains a Python script that performs data preprocessing, analysis, and machine learning model training to classify kidney disease. The dataset used in this project can be downloaded from the specified location in the script.

Features

- *Data Loading and Inspection*: Load the dataset using Pandas, inspect the data, and get initial insights.
- *Data Cleaning*: Handle missing values and correct inconsistencies in the dataset.
- *Data Transformation*: Convert categorical variables to numerical ones.
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Visualize the data using Seaborn to understand the relationships between features.
- *Model Training and Evaluation*: Train multiple machine learning models and evaluate their performance.

Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter.

bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
pip install -r requirements.txt
python kidney_disease.py


Data Preprocessing

- *Reading Data*: Load the dataset from a CSV file.
- *Initial Inspection*: Display the first few rows and get a summary of the dataset.
- *Handling Missing Values*: Replace missing values with mean or mode as appropriate.
- *Converting Data Types*: Convert specific text columns to numeric.

Exploratory Data Analysis

- *Correlation Heatmap*: Visualize the correlation between different features.
- *Data Distribution*: Check the distribution of the target variable (classification).

Machine Learning Models

- *Decision Tree Classifier*: Train and predict using a Decision Tree.
- *Comparison of Multiple Models*: Train and compare performance of Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and SVM.

Evaluation Metrics

- *Confusion Matrix*: Evaluate model performance using a confusion matrix.
- *Accuracy, F1 Score, Recall, Precision*: Calculate and display various evaluation metrics for each model.
